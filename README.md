## milib

This is an image manipulation library I wrote a number of years ago for the Card2Anywhere project. Now it's open source!
It provides an selection of basic and not-so-basic operations.

To see what functionality is available, have a look at the Interop.Milib/ImageOperations.cs file or milib/ directory.
